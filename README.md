## Motivation&Requirements

The purpose of this development is to create a simple yet intelligent __Web Site__ called _MovieRoom_.


### Key Requirements

The following list contains some key requirements for better overview of application's functionality and effect:

1. Website will __recomend__ its users __movies to watch__ based on their preferences and history of watched movies.
2. Users will have as __actual movie data__ as possible to work with.
3. Website will __save its users' time__ by automating manual movie search.

The above requirements represent our personal motivation for our project.

>__Functional Requirements__ commonly emerge from Business Requirements. Check _design_ folder for more details.

## Project Structure

Currently, the respository is split into following subdirectories:

1. __design__
    - Contains full __UI/UX design__ sketched using _Figma Design Tool_. Design is represented by multiple images which capture various Panels included in our Web Site.
2. __model__
    - Contains complete model of our application to get abstract representation of our project. During this phase we identified various software aspects, like requirements, use cases, actors, database ERD, etc.
2. __src__
    - Contains __Source Code__ of our website, we define __DOM structure__ using _HTML_, apply styles using _CSS_ and also include some interactions coded in _JavaScript_.
